Ease of Setup - There was some manual installation and environment setup required, but it only required a small amount of effort on the user's behalf.
Most of the commands to configure this environment are simple.
4/5

Effectiveness of Documentation - Documentation is extensive and up-to-date, with easy access to thorough tutorials.
The API reference is well put-together and easy to navigate
5/5

Capacity for Demonstration - The language is relatively fast-loading, so demonstrative changes could be made to the code while demonstrating a practice problem.
There are also some useful visualization tools.
4/5

Intuitiveness of Language - This language enhances the user's understanding of quantum programming. 
It follows a class structure that focuses on the circuit without any extraneous steps to produce it. 
There is not a large number of imports necessary for working with the functions, but there is still some "real" programming value.
