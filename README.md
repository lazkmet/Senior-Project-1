# Senior-Project-1
This repository contains files from my survey of various quantum programming toolkits

This repository is organized into folder branches; each branch contains the code used to evaluate a single toolkit. Branches will contain a repeated file/folder structure consisting of:

../Example_Circuit/ - This folder will contain any code or project files created to test the toolkit

../Prerequisites.txt - This will contain a list of software prerequisites and any applicable download links

../Readme.txt - This will contain a more detailed instruction set for setup and testing of the example code, as well as any applicable download links (same as Prerequisites).

There are 4 main branches, each representing a different Quantum Programming toolkit:
Blueqat
Qiskit
QPS (Quantum Programming Studio)
Qulacs

I have tried my best to ensure that each test is accomplished without use of the prerequisites installed for the other toolkits, but I am not infallible. It is possible that a prerequisite has been met without my knowledge, and if that is the case you can email me at lkmet@ltu.edu with any questions regarding the setup process. I will respond to the best of my ability.

I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid in completing this work, nor have I submitted someone else's work as my own.
