Ease of Setup - There was very little installation required. One merely had to prepare the environment, and run a console command.
5/5

Effectiveness of Documentation - The documentation itself is well-managed and pretty easy to navigate. However, the API Reference does not provide much detail into what the circuits do, instead relying on prior knowledge.
This is easily offset by the detailed tutorials they provide on their GitHub, including many example algorithms as well as a basic explanation of the concepts of quantum programming.
4/5

Capacity for Demonstration - The language allows for easy modifications to the circuit for live "what if?" style demonstrations.
The included circuit drawing tool is easy to use and understand, but does not seem to allow for formatting changes
4/5

Intuitiveness of Language - This toolkit very much enhances understanding of quantum programming. The ability to sequentially chain gates on a circuit allows for exploration and keeps implementation simple.
There are very few additional parameters needed for circuit development, and simulation only requires a single, easy-to-understand function.
With this toolkit, the focus is on the quantum logic and the circuits themselves, not on learning how to use the language or figuring out how to properly display results.
