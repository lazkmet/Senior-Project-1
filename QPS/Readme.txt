///Quantum Programming Studio///

This evaluation considered the web IDE called Quantum Programming Studio (QPS for short). The backing language is 
OpenQASM, a language specifically developed for Quantum Programming. QPS includes an OpenQASM text editor, drag-and-drop visual interface, and a backend API for external programs to connect to.
As this project is focused on undergraduate educational use, the evaluation will focus on the code editor and visual interface.

Configuration Steps:

1. Register an Account with QPS - Go to https://quantum-circuit.com/ in your preferred web browser. 
On the home page, click "Register" or "Get started", and fill out a username, email, and password.

2. Confirm your email - A confirmation email will be sent to the email you associated with your account. Open it and click the link to verify your email.

3. Create a new project - Code projects are managed as either 'Public' or 'Private'. Select your preferred setting, then begin working with the environment.
